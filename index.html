                    <p>I am a PhD student in the Computational and Quantitative Biology (EDCB) program at EPFL. Originally from the United States, I completed my BSc in Molecular Biology and Computer Science at the University of Pittsburgh before working as a research fellow at EMBL Heidelberg.
                    
                    During my studies, I have been captivated by the concept of temporal omics and bioinformatics in light of the big data boom and advances in next-generation sequencing technologies. One ambition of my PhD is to help bridge the gap between experimental and computational approaches, since the most important discoveries in biology will ultimately benefit from a union of these perspectives. I am using single-cell transcriptomic methods to explore the developing nervous system and eye in several species. I am also contributing to expansion of the bioinformatics toolkit available to the single-cell community. My long term goal is to contribute to the shift in biology from a descriptive to predictive science. I am eager for opportunities to explore my interests and strengthen new skills in both industry and academia, particularly in the dynamic atmosphere of Switzerland and Europe.</p>
